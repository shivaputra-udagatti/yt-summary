Title: "(605) Why boundaries are good for relationships | Oren Tene | TEDxBatGalim - YouTube"
Transcript: "[Music] how is it I'm often asked as a psychiatrist that I face pain and Insanity every day and not go crazy myself or becoming different let me take you to a peek today in my office closed word sea at 3 30 pm and I'm with my yoga mattress already ready for my yoga class it's been a long week a long day and I really want to go when I hear an all too familiar sound first screams then the alarm all nurses to close towards see all nurses to clothe towards C I know what will happen next and indeed the door is thrust open and a young 20 year old man or boy runs toward me screaming you are the devil you murdered my parents in situations like this I hardly have time to think you know I I immediately like organize myself and give orders medical orders to sedate this fearful young man and help him and that's what I do soon after in my office I'm again ready to go my yoga mattress again on my shoulder and I step outside only to find the parents of this young new patient of mine waiting outside and they have lots of questions what will happen to our son what has happened to him what did you give him how long will this last how long will he be hospitalized is this a chronic situation they want to answer these questions I want to help them they need me but I see the clock above the mother's head and it's already says 4 30. I can still make it to my yoga class what would you do in this situation it seems that the answer is quite easy well I went to yoga I mumbled something about having to run away and explaining everything tomorrow and ran to my yoga class I made it on time half an hour later while practicing vlikshasana here it is it's the tree pose oh I can still do it half an hour later then it strikes me I'm a monster how could I do this the parents of this child need me he's probably going to be diagnosed with schizophrenia he's their life will never be the same his life will never be the same yoga now is it really that important is this is what I learned medicine for all these years you must think I'm a monster too but let me fast forward to a different scenario I'm now sitting in a clinic in front of me a 40 year old man who has just lost his nine-year-old daughter to a violent type of brain cancer he's crying and I want to cry too I cannot stop thinking about one of my kids which is who is exactly the same age and I want to tell this man of course you want to die what other option is there but then a moment before doing so I think Oren that's my name this is not about you it's about him I actually play some sort of barrier between me and the pain and start talking the next day this father calls me he thanks me turns out I helped him two different stories right very different stories but are they really that different in the first I'm a villain in the second devoted therapist but these two stories share a theme and the theme is when does over involvement when does involvement turn into over involvement when is Detachment something cruel and when is it necessary when vital for us to survive and be able to help others it is this lesson learned in the chaotic fields of the soul that I want to share with you today but in no way is this a lesson of psychiatry it's a lesson that has to do with all of us it's relevant to every relationship that has pain in inside being being us as parents of course lots of pain there being us as children to aging parents to to spouses to bosses to employees everywhere it is here where boundaries and borders come to our rescue and they do so in more than one way let me show you how the first way requires us to answer truthfully a difficult question who is it that we're actually helping when we're breaking boundaries is it the person in front of us or maybe ourselves I'm no stranger to Breaking boundaries with patients I remember myself as a young psychiatrist just you know learning about the power and the magic of psychotherapy I haven't a new patient he's 21 years old and he captures my heart his father died when he was five his mother a doctor like me Works continuously to support the family and I think immediately that I'm the answer to all of his problems I can be the father he never had when he asked for two sessions a week of course I obliged he needs me I'm overwhelmed by this amazing feeling that I'm so important in someone else's life when he's late for meetings I give him extra time when he wants my private phone I give it to him I'm needed but then reality knocks it usually does in psychotherapies and in this case I had to go on and leave a study leave my midterm exams were just around the corner my I had a month off and my boss called me into his office and tells me Aaron you can't come to the to the hospital in this month it's about you passing these exams you can't come in even for for your patient for Michael let's call him I think okay it's only a month I'll prepare Michael for this separation it's a brief separation and I try to do so but of course it's useless because my abandonment Echoes so many experiences that he had in his past soon after I leave Michael is hospitalized for suicidal ideation and the therapy never resumes today I know that I was not helping Michael by breaking boundaries with him I was helping myself I was helping my insecurities and my feeling that I want to feel able and competent think about it at home if your child throws a tantrum and you're the only one in the world who can calm them down isn't it the great feeling but think again is it really is that what you want that you will be the only one in the world who can calm your children so they cannot calm themselves or anybody other I think the answer to that is no so the first thing borders and boundaries protect us from is from the dangerous notion that we're omnipotent or putting it other in other words if you feel like a God then sorry you're doing something wrong the second way in which boundaries and borders protect us is by their ability to reassure Jenny is another patient of mine I remember her being brought into the closed Ward for the first time she was all over the place terrible violent paranoid State scratching yelling screaming soon after arrival I went to examine her and was surprised to find her relatively calm what did you give her ask my boss nothing yet he said he said a phrase I remember that's the power of the walls later on in my career and my life I learned that many patients like Jenny whose life and this world become chaotic and terrifying are reassured by the structure of the closed Ward not only of the physical structure but also of the daily routine it's not just our patients think of us during the pandemic indeed external boundaries reflect inner wants and give us a sense of security today we live in a World Without Borders we love saying right the sky is the limit they tell us you can do anything you want sounds fantastic but it's actually for a primitive self quite terrifying you know 200 years ago and for thousands of years before that people knew what they will what will happen to them you know from the day they are born till the day they die you know born a farmer grow old as a farmer dies a farmer for most of humanity what do we know today about what will happen tomorrow what do we know about what our children will do when they grow up we don't even know how jobs in life will look like then you know a World Without Limits and borders it's a fantastic concept but it's actually quite a challenging and even terrifying reality I know that boundaries can sometimes seem cruel you know when I'm sitting at my psychologist at my therapists on the couch and I'm crying and she tells me our time is up I'm quite devastated when when a therapist you know somebody tells him about their financial problems and he still charges the high sum at the end how is that right but think an answer would you want your therapist to sometimes give you 65 minutes and sometimes 30 40 50. how would you feel on the last days would you want your therapist to see you every week in a different time slot that's you know that's good with your calendar would you want them to say to you after a while well I don't think we need the money anymore let's just talk it's so much fun won't that just make therapy another friendship would you really want that I think the answer is no so why is it that we think that our children want us to break boundaries with them why is it that we think that we want to let them sit in front of screens all day stay up all night not go to school if they want to eat sweets speaking of sweets you know my daughter is a sweet tooth she loves candy and we always have the argument the same argument about how many desserts she's allowed only one I remember one night I was distracted and tired and during this argument I just said to her go on have as many as you want she looked up at me terrified and said Daddy are you okay what's wrong so you see boundaries and borders protect us they reassure us ourselves our children our patients our surroundings they also remind us that we are not the Gods but that is not all because the third way in which boundaries and borders help us is by enabling us to love ourselves our surroundings our children yes also our children the Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson he's a very controversial figure uh but listen to one of his phrases more known phrases he says don't let your children do anything that will make you dislike them it's like our own kids is that even a possibility well of course it is and this also comes back to boundaries if we let our children you know run around be ignorant rude and do whatever they want think that we're at their disposal 24 7 we will end up resenting them at work if we let our employees call us at any time with any stupid question with whatever they want we will head our phones hate our employees hit our jobs and in the hospital where everything every crisis is always so much bigger than everything that's going on in my life if I will not know how to set the barrier and say this is what I can do today the rest will have to wait for tomorrow then I will be failing as a caregiver because I will not be able to love my job and my patients who need my love back to yoga then because you hear yoga but I hear a vacation much needed vacation you hear yoga but I hear a date for two with a candle dinner do you hear yoga but I hear family time a few hours a day in which I turn off my phone in which my employees now they cannot disturb me in which the demanding world is just shut outside and I have time to be with my kids by placing this barrier by this limit I can actually continue to love my job and do it with a lot of you know will and happiness as I do you see immersing in the Endless Sea of pain in a relationship is always an option but ironically it's the easy option setting flexible barriers and boundaries that detach us from the pain and enable us to empathetically touch others is actually the right way to go around at least that's what I think so I invite you to do the same decide what is essential for you what are the boundaries important for you at home with your kids with your spouse at work with your boss with your employees with your parents anywhere go on and choose your yoga it will not make you a monster it will just enable you to love others more easily thank you very much [Applause] [Music]"'''
